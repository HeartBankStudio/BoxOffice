# BoxOffice

## What does your project do?

## How to set it up

We ask that you develop your application and run the other projects during evaluation in a VirtualBox VM running Ubuntu 16.04 to reduce the chances of run time environment variables.

## Requirements

### User Interface Requirements:
- Run the app on a dev server locally for testing/grading
- You should be able to visit a URL and interact with the application
- App recognizes current account
  - Sign transactions using MetaMask / uPort
  - Contract state is updated
  - Update reflected in UI

### Test Requirements:
- Write 5 tests for each contract you wrote
- Solidity or JavaScript
  - Explain why you wrote those tests
- Tests run with truffle test
 
### Design Pattern Requirements:
- Implement emergency stop
- What other design patterns have you used / not used?
  - Why did you choose the patterns that you did?
  - Why not others?
 
### Security Tools / Common Attacks:
- Explain what measures youâ€™ve taken to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks
 
### Use a library
- Via EthPM or write your own

  
### Stretch requirements (for bonus points, not required):
- Deploy your application onto the Rinkeby test network. Include a document called deployed_addresses.txt that describes where your contracts live on the test net.
- Integrate with an additional service, maybe even one we did not cover in this class
- For example:
  - IPFS
  - uPort
  - Ethereum Name Service
  - Oracle
